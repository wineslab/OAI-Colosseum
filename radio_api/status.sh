# status.sh - This script is called by the Colosseum to check on the radio state.
# No input is accepted.
# Output should be given by way of STDOUT as a serialized JSON dictionary.
# The dictionary must contain a STATUS key with a state string as a value.
# The dictionary may contain an INFO key with more detailed messages for the team.
# STDERR may be logged, but the exit status is always checked.
# The script should return 0 to signify successful execution.

# ---Example Usage---
#check if there is an input argument for error exit example
if [ $# -ne 0 ]
then exit 64 #exit with an error
fi

# MESSAGE=""

# # check to see if our state file even exists
# if [ -e /tmp/NR_STATE ]; then
#     STATE=`cat /tmp/NR_STATE`

#     if [ -z "$STATE" ]; then
#         STATE="BOOTING"
#         MESSAGE="NR_STATE is blank"
#     fi
# else
#     STATE="BOOTING"
#     MESSAGE="NR_STATE is missing"
